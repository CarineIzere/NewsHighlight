# NEWS_HIGHLIGHT

      My parents, Friends, Siblings and Husband are busy workers and they get home really late. They always miss the news and they are very frustrated since they can't keep up with current affairs. This is a News Website App that is primarily concerned with making its users get information and updates about latest happenings around the globe(world). I think it will be helpful to them.
      This is a Python-Flask application for displaying News Highlights from various News sources using a [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
